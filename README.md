# Hello, I am Ishant 👋

This repo shows my web development experience, and practice in other languages as well.

## Main Projects
These are the main projects that best show my web development skill:

1. [Youtube clone](/YoutubeCopy/) - Followed a video from SuperSimpleDev. ([Link](https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc?si=loeyQMkEseAT1uK9))
2. [To Do App](/NoteTakingApp/) - Followed a video from CodingToGo. ([Link](https://youtu.be/gzoifHuIsrI?si=yIBWGTCsahzhZHGA))
3. [Microsoft To Do Clone](/MSToDoCopy/) - My own project built on previous practice. 

## Practice Exercises and Small Projects

In my Practice folder, I have small exercises to understand different topics in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
